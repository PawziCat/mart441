### Reflection:
This project frustrated me to no end. I had everything working and displaying properly, up until I tried to start styling things. Now the game will simply not draw the objects when I initiate the game in a live server, in browser or on the live site. When I look in the developer tools, ther are no errors of any kind, almost like its fetching the JSON but not actually displaying it. I threw my code into both ChatGPT and Copilot and neither of them could find any errors either. I am absolutely mystified, where are the objects if there are no errors and the code is being fetched? The game is contained to the page, the elements are in their respective divs that are arranged in my game container. The tree different kinds of game objects all have their own json, they each have their own classes and arrays. Prior to my code having issues, the game ran fine, the player initiated and collided with obstacles, it collected the collectibles but now it just doesn't. When the code is not broke, but still not working.
