### Reflection:
1. Changed the sprite to a fox-like creature
2. Added more platforms. 
* Changed the platform file to a new one
* created a shorter length of platform for variety
3. added a jump key using the space bar
4. Added a second collectible object, a diamond worth 40pts. The diamond are not needed to complete a round and so they are bonus points.
5. Added gravity to the stars that are created after the first set of stars are collected. 
* The first wave of stars have a slight bounce to them. 
* The second wave introduces the ghost and stars with gravity. 
* Created to run infinitely so long as the player does not die. Each time the player successfully collects the stars, another ghost will appear along with the next round of stars. Each new round has the chance for you to earn 80 points with 120 bonus points for a total of 200pts possible per round.

#### Additional changes:
* Changed game sky / background
* added borders and walls using modified files from the platforms

### Reflection:
I really wish that I could have figured out how to have the stars appear on the game randomly instead of simply falling from the sky to land on the platforms. This is why I added the gravity to the game for consecutive waves, to add both challenge and visual interest. Instead I found a way to stagger the diamonds so that they ended up on multiple platforms.
