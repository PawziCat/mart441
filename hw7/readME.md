#### Project Reflection

This project was actually fairly easy after the last one since I only had to set up the one array. I used a constructor with my class to initialize my image objects in the array. I set up my function for the image switcher button so that the images would randomly change when clicked and update the description for each image. I chose to style my View Master in a way that was reminisent of a real View Master.

#### Challenges
I noticed an odd issue that occurs when clicking the image switcher button, there is some sort of lag, this is the only go way to describe it. I'm wondering if it due to the way that I chose to code my View Master or if it is some how randomly generating the same image. I chose to pursue the later and ended up changing the constants that I used before assigning current index to a variable and using a "do-while" loop. This did in fact fix the issue.
