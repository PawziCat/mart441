                            Born and raised in Colorado, I worked as a graphic designer in the past for six years before pursuing other interests, in particular education for the last five years. Prior to this I initially started out going to school to become a teacher and quickly discovered that I was drawn to working in special education. I have an associates in Inclusive Early Education and have spent a year working at the Colorado School for the Deaf and Blind. Prior to this I ran a daycare for low-income families for children with disabilities where I specialized in Early Intervention for Autism Spectrum Disorder and ADHD. However, life happens and becoming a teacher was no longer an option for me. While discouraging, it didn't change my desire to help students with learning barriers such as those who are non-native English learners or those with disabilities. During my time as a teacher, I began to recognize that games could be a powerful way to help students learn. My long-term goal is to develop interactive media that can be used to improve learning outcomes for students, with a focus on students with disabilities in particular. I believe there are so many ways that interactive media and by extension games, can be used to push education forward, it's just a matter of developing it and making it accessible to schools and parents. I am very excited to further explore web technology. It is my hope that this class will help me develop skills and provide insight that can aid me in reaching my goals.

                            During my free time, I generally I spend my time drawing, reading, researching various topics, playing games with my husband and cuddling up with my dogs to watch a couple episodes of something before bed. I am also an avid consumer of anime and manga. My husband and I bond and spend our time playing video games together, either multiplayer games or we just parallel play. Some of our favorite games to play together are Final Fantasy XIV (a MMORPG), 7 Days to Die, Ark Survival Evolved/Ascended, the Fable series the Elder Scrolls series, Baulder's Gate 3, and in warmer weather Pokemon GO on dog walks. When I play alone some other games I enjoy are Hogwarts Legacy, Shadows of War, the Assasin's Creed series, the Final Fantasy series, the Kingdom Hearts series. I also play a couple mobile apps like Harvest Town and puzzles or games like Pokemon, Slime Rancher and Paleo Pines when I want to play something less serious with low investment. I also mess around with various educational games in order to better understand them, what went into their creation and what makes them effective as a game (fun) and as an educational tool.

                We all have that game that sticks with us; compelling stories, character development, conflict and resolution and to the immersiveness of the world within the game. For me that game was Fable 3 and to this day the game holds a special place in my heart. While Fable 3 was by no means the first game I ever played (this honor goes to that lovable little guy, Curby), it was the first game I had ever finished. It started my love of video games... I found myself lost within a Victorian-esque world amdist an industrial revolution and a civil war where my choices determined how it all ended. It also turned me into a completionist after I replayed the game over and over to get all the endings and achievements, a habit I maintain to this day. Fable as a series is well known and beloved because it was so immersive and gave the player a higher level of choice with in game consequences that altered the direction of the story and future interations. You add this to a beautiful world experiencing that at the time had some of the best video graphics, not just in cutscenes but in game play itself. Fable 3 was innovative and really set a new standard for future RPG games.
