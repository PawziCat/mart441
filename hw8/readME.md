Project Reflection
I had a really hard time getting my shapes, images and triangles to move independently with their own time intervals. To accomplish this in the end I created individual styles for each elements. I used jquery to do the initial setup, intervals the elements switched at, intervals that they move at and where elements will appear when switched. I was unable to get the page content to stay withing the page container but was unable to. This causes some of the elements do not fade in within the page but outside of it. I chose to use Math.floor(Math.random() to randomize the movements of the elements to create greater visual interest. I wish I have added a button that initialized the page though rather than having the elements jsut ont he page when loaded.
