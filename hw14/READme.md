### Reflection:
For some reason I really struggled with this week's assignment. The video tutorials provided by Professor Cassens are out of date compared to the thre.js website which has changed its tutorial and downloads / the process to use AND on the three.js-master ZIP that is provided via link on the class' external website. As a result I struggled to find the right three.js file and in the end I used the one found in the instructors gitHub and this one was named three.min.js and not three.js. Once I was able to find the needed file the rest of the assignment was relatively easy once I figured out how to animate the shapes and create more than one shape, each with their animate functions. I changed the model for my project to the bust of Walt Disney. I also added some color to it for visual interest and to help emphasis the different shapes if and when they overlapped.
