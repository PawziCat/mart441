### Reflection:
For my project this week, I chose to display the NASA data for the Asteriods in this galaxy. Amoung this info is the designation (name), discovery date, magnitude, distance (MOID, perihelion and aphelion), orbital period, inclination, PHA (potentially hazardous asteroid), and orbit class.Since I have an interest in education I also wanted to tak the chance to display this data along side NASA's Asteroid tracker. This provides a location, orbit pattern, and even a rendering of scans taken of the asteroid. I thought this would be a really fun way for kids to explore asteroids in our galaxy as it allows for alot of student agency. 

I took a good amount of work to get my data set to display properly, I had issues in the beginning defining the data that was suppose to be called, I figured out I had typos in my code for my JSONajax file, which ended up fixing the issue entirely. Nothing like chasing commas!
