#### Successes

One of the biggest successes that I achieved during my project was that I was able to get my adventure to loop back around on itself so that you could rexplore areas or choose a different path. In one of the paths, you are actually required to find a key in order to even find the chest in the cave. I also had some successes in getting an inventory system to add or remove items.

I believe that I did a great job putting in comments for the code in a manner that would make it easier for me to return back to the project in the future. Additionally this is great practice for future projects to ensure that another person could read them and understand what was going on. 

#### Challenges 

One of the biggest challenges that I face during the project what figuring out how to get my functions to work properly. I eventually had to abandon having a health/damage system as a result of this struggles. I also had a hard time structuring my story event choices in a way that made sense. 

A huge challenge that I had that I also experienced successes with was the inventory system. If you go down the northern road and encounter the little thief **after** you go into either the cave or the roots, you can re-acquire the starting inventory (sword, torch, 25 gold coins, ration), but all your inventory and items obtained from the other directions are lost (gem, rusty key, treasure cache, flower).

#### Additional Notes:
For the images, I chose to only change the images based on entering or exiting areas or by having an encounter. An example of this is when you take the winding path to the roots, you see images for the flowers, tunnels among the roots, an egg in an nest, a basilisk and a stone statue if you die here.
