### Homework 15 Update
* Fixed the issue where the platforms had a odd issue where the png for the platforms and the collider for them were not functioning together properly. Discovered it was because of the setScale for the platforms as setScale(2) when the code does not allow for that. The solution was to return the setScale to setScale(1). This required me to make additional changes to the code and the the platform pngs.
* add sound effects to the collected diamonds.
* add sound effects to the collected stars.
* Refined later "levels" so that the gravity is smoother.


### Planned Additional Changes:
* Added a level system in which when all the stars are collect, the level will change when the next round of objects and / or enemies appear.
* POSSIBLY add other enemies.
* add sound effects to the Fox.
* add sound effects to the ghost when they hit a platform.
* add sound effect when the player dies.


#### Notes:
All assets were collected from a tutorial and assets provided in the class.
