#### Game Reflection

This is a cool little game project that has so many applications as it demonstrates basic point-and-click game mechanics. It also provides a basic introduction into how arrays work and how to use them. 

#### Successes

I found quite a bit of success in setting up my first array (blank array) and the second array (image array). Even though it was a struggle, I was also able to get my game to flip over cards that were not properly matched. During the continuation of this project, I had little issues with setting up the html and css for my form and buttons, and just followed the same color them that I had been using before.

#### Challenges 

The only real challenge that I had during the project was getting my loop for shuffling my array to work. This is where the choice to use a Fisher-Yates algorithm came from. I also had to debug the checkMatch as it was not returning the cards to facing down, this required additional research and a few failed attempts. I believe I spent more time on debuggign this than I did on the rest of the project. During the second part of the project, it took a bit of work to get the information that was gathered to actually display at the end of the game like it was supposed to. In the end it was something as silly as my form not storing and recalling the player information from the JSON properly.
