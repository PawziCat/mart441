### Techniques and Elements:
* For my site page I utilized column-based layout, in the future it will be easier to maintain structure and organization as the page is expanded or other pages are added
* A series of div containers and sections were used in order keep content from over flowing.
* Used Meta@ to attempt to control max and min width and height.
* Used a parallax image for the page to add visual interest, the image stays fixed an functions as a backround instead of adding a body color.
* Used the banner section to put my logo and company name on the site.
* Used paragraph and header stylings to create cohesive design.
* Added fonts to my site.
* Used images to add visual interest.


### Interactive Element:
* Used a collapsable to add visual interest and reduce the information on the page into managable parts. This also breaks up the sections into distint parts.
* Added a menu with a drop down that is static and only loops index.
* Placed an embedded map.


### Probems or Frustrations:
* Im not sure if my meta@s are functioning properly or if I even did them correctly, I feel like I need help understanding them better.
* My email will not stay in the container / section of the left column.
* Columns with images keep extending rather than shifting above or below the other column on smaller screens.
* for some reason the font Poppins will not load on the site and is being ran as the alt font sans-serif.


### Reflection:
* I have a slider-test.html in the hw1 folder that I was using to experiment with for a carousel from my final in MART341.
* Extra styles in the css styles and bootstraps in the js folder that are not currently in use on the static site.
